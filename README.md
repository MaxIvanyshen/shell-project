# shell-project

All the information for this project I've taken from [this paper](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/grr/SystemsProgrammingBook/Book/Chapter5-WritingYourOwnShell.pdf)

## Parts of a Shell Program
- The Parser
- The Executor
- Shell Subsystems

1. The Parser is the software component that reads the command line such as “ls ­al” and puts it 
into a data structure called Command Table that will store the commands that will be 
executed.   

2. The executor will take the command table generated by the parser and for every 
SimpleCommand in the array it will create a new process. It will also if necessary create pipes 
to communicate the output of one process to the input of the next one. Additionally, it will 
redirect the standard input, standard output, and standard error if there are any redirections. 

3. Shell Subsystems are: 

● Environment Variables: Expressions of the form ${VAR} are expanded with the 
corresponding environment variable. Also the shell should be able to set, expand and 
print environment vars. 
● Wildcards: Arguments of the form a*a are expanded to all the files that match them in 
the local directory and in multiple directories . 
● Subshells: Arguments between `` (backticks) are executed and the output is sent as 
input to the shell.
